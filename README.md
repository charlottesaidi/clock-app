# Frontend Mentor - Clock App solution

Solution to the [Clock App challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clock-app-LMFaxFwrM). A small clock app using World Time and Geolocation APIs. 

Update : Had to "ditch" the World Time api, I think the thing is down or extra buggy, dunno. Had to revert to pure JS to get the date and calculate datas like timezone, day of the year, etc ...
